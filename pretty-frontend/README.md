# ChainLoader

It is deployed at [https://storage-dapp.herokuapp.com](https://storage-dapp.herokuapp.com).

Features include:

## Notes

* The app is currently in development.
* The app is designed to be used with a contract deployed on the [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) network.
* Downloading files does not require a crypto wallet, as the Polygon RPC URI is used as the node/access point for the smart contract calls.
* Extensive tutorials are accessible within the app.
