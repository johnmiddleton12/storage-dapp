### Frontend App built with React

This is a React app that is used to interact with the file storage smart contract.

The app allows the user to both download and upload files to the smart contract.

Downloading files does not require a crypto wallet, as the Polygon RPC URI is used as the node/access point for the smart contract calls.

Uploading files requires a crypto wallet, and currently the only support crypto wallet is [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/).
